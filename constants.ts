    details: "My journey began with building online systems in the healthcare and insurance sector using Microsoft technologies such as ASP, VB6, C#, and SQL Server. I learned how to design intuitive user interfaces, write reliable business logic, manage data securely, and understand what users truly need from technology.\n\nI then advanced into developing large clinical and financial systems used by hospitals, insurance providers, and operational administrators. I built features for claims processing, eligibility checks, biometric attendance systems, and operational reporting. This helped me gain experience modernising legacy platforms, integrating multiple modules, and ensuring accuracy, compliance, and trust in data-driven environments.\n\nAs a Technical Lead and Architect, I focused on enterprise integration. I designed secure services, data-exchange frameworks, and intranet platforms serving thousands of users. My work using WCF, BizTalk, SAP integration, and SQL Server ensured that corporate systems remained connected, consistent, and highly available. I successfully replaced fragmented legacy applications with unified platforms that improved operational efficiency and reduced complexity.\n\nMy next major career phase began when I worked on global servicing and content platforms for a leading financial organisation. I helped modernise credit card servicing applications across the US and 23 international markets by replacing mainframe dependencies, consolidating duplicate systems, and enabling new Pega-based business processes. I also transformed the enterprise content management ecosystem — migrating 60TB of legacy imaging data to a modern platform and implementing real-time document notifications. This work improved scalability, reduced technology costs, and strengthened enterprise-wide compliance.\n\nI later delivered strategic architecture for major financial and insurance transformation initiatives. I designed a commercial lending platform that unified more than 100 applications and supported multi-billion-pound loan processing. I also introduced robotic automation to reduce manual operations and associated costs. In the insurance sector, I modernised critical policy and sales systems with Pega BPM, cloud-based infrastructure, and advanced security controls. These roles deepened my expertise in enterprise strategy, platform consolidation, and multi-team leadership.\n\nToday, I serve as a Staff Engineer and Solutions Architect specialising in AI, machine learning, Generative AI, RAG-based chatbots, and modern cloud architectures. I have designed and delivered a next-generation, serverless knowledge and learning platform that decommissioned legacy systems and reduced operating costs by ~$2M per year. I developed ML models to improve search accuracy and built BERT-based question-answering capabilities for instant information retrieval. I now lead the development of an enterprise Generative AI chatbot using LLMs, vector search, prompt engineering, and a RAG evaluation framework. Alongside engineering delivery, I mentor teams, influence enterprise architecture strategy, and drive responsible technology innovation across global servicing functions.\n\nAcross every role, my focus has remained consistent: solving real business problems, simplifying complex environments, reducing operational costs, improving user experience, and adopting new technologies in a secure and scalable way.",

    title: "Technologies",
    content: "Extensive hands-on experience across diverse technology stacks including **Python, Java, Microsoft .NET, API and microservices architecture**, cloud platforms, and AI/ML technologies such as **ML model development, Generative AI, and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.",
    details: "I have developed deep, hands-on experience across multiple technology stacks — starting with the Microsoft .NET ecosystem, progressing into large-scale enterprise integration, and now leading modern cloud-native and AI-driven engineering.\n\nI began by building full-stack applications using C#, VB.Net, ASP.NET, SQL Server, and JavaScript, which gave me strong foundations in designing complete systems — from database models to secure business logic and user-friendly interfaces.\n\nAs I moved into integration and architecture roles, I worked extensively with BizTalk, WCF, SAP integration, IBM DataPower, and messaging technologies such as IBM MQ and SOLACE to ensure critical business platforms could seamlessly communicate and share data.\n\nMy technical capability expanded further into cloud computing, event-driven design, and modern web technologies. I have delivered large-scale systems using REST APIs, microservices, serverless architectures, data caching, CI/CD pipelines, and real-time search solutions using Java, Node.js, React, ElasticSearch, Redis, Couchbase, and SQL and NoSQL databases.\n\nMost recently, my focus has been AI, machine learning and Generative AI. I have hands-on experience building AI services using Python, transformer models, BERT-based NLP, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain orchestration frameworks, vector databases like PGVector and Redis, and semantic search using ElasticSearch.\n\nI combine these AI capabilities with enterprise architecture practices to ensure solutions are scalable, secure, well-governed, and cost-efficient.\n\nThrough every technology shift, I have remained adaptable — always selecting the right tools for the problem, reducing technical complexity, and enabling organisations to deliver smarter, more efficient digital experiences.",

    details: "I have worked across multiple high-impact industries where technology must support strong security, regulatory compliance, and advanced customer servicing capabilities.\n\nMy early work focused on healthcare and insurance. I built systems for hospitals, care providers, and insurers, including solutions for claims management, eligibility, biometric attendance, and financial reporting. These applications required high data accuracy, privacy, and reliability.\n\nI then broadened into digital imaging and consumer technology where I worked on photo sharing and device integration platforms that connected cameras, printers, and media workflows to the web. This strengthened my ability to build reliable, user-centric digital experiences.\n\nA major part of my career has been in banking and financial services, particularly global credit card servicing, commercial lending, enterprise content management, and operational automation. I designed architecture that supported millions of customers, multiple markets, and large-scale regulatory needs while transforming legacy systems into scalable platforms.\n\nMost recently, I have specialised in servicing, knowledge management, and AI-driven platforms. My focus includes generative AI, RAG chatbots, semantic search, vector retrieval, and graph-based knowledge systems. These domains bring together customer care, learning, and content intelligence to improve outcomes for call centre agents and customers.\n\nWorking across these domains has given me strong experience in designing systems that balance operational efficiency, secure data handling, and continuous innovation while ensuring compliance, high availability, and trust in the technology that supports modern enterprises.",
